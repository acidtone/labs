## What you'll learn in this lab
- Make `<div>` elements into circles with `border-radius`.
- Vertically centre elements with Flexbox and `margin: auto`.
- Create a split-colour background with custom gradient colour stops.
- Overlap a semi-transparent image with absolute positioning and `opacity`.

### 1. Vertically centre two equally spaced grey circles in the viewport.
